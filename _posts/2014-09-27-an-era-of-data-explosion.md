  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">We are currently in a new era of Data Explosion..!</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-145" src="http://sathiyaprabhu.com/look-inside/uploads/2014/10/data-explosion-272x300.png" alt="data-explosion" width="277" height="306" />Image Source: http://visual.ly/data-never-sleeps-20</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">So what this era all about? what are all the potential causes for this era, and what are all its consequences..?</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">I speculate it is due to technological outgrowth and change in our life style. If we walk few years back and compare our life style now and then</span> we could realize how much our life style has changed in a very short span of time. Let's take an example about the usage of mobile phones. Few years back, mobile phones used to be a mark of luxury and had very limited usage mostly to call somebody during a emergency or for very few necessary things. But currently, the usage of mobile phones is insane! Mobile phone became part of our human body, and it's difficult to spend a day without it. There are also many peoples using mobile phones without any carrier. Mobile Phones deprecate most of the devices taking multiple shapes like Dictionary, Watch, Torch, Alarm, Compass, FM Player, Sensor, GPS, Navigator, till spinning a cloud instances in Amazon EC2..
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Another big revolution is approaching that could also end up becoming a part of our human body with the name Smart Watch. Probably in few years we could turn back to current days to realize the usages of watch. In few years, all our normal watches gonna be smart. How smart? It can read our heart beats, suggest some health tips, can play some music depending on our mood, walk you to an unexplored place etc.. Well, if it could read peoples around us and tell whether the girl next to us like us or not, that would solve many problems :)</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Since all these tiny devices that we use in out everyday live got intelligence, they start generating and also utilising a lot of data. Internet of Things (IOT) is an emerging research area which is all about Internet for all! Not only for humans, but also for all the living/non-living things that one can imagine. So apparently, the amount of data that has to be stored and processed dramatically increasing to a large extent. So what are it's consequences? We need a database to store all these data. When people took all these data to our 35-40 years old friend RDBMS: Relational Database System, it stumbled.  Ohhh..! that's so big. And we are like, Yes, that's so Big, tagging it with a label Big Data and started to find a new friend who can be easy with the current data explosion. Luckily, the guys with big pockets like Google, Amazon, and Facebook started working on this problem bit early and gave birth to a new data storage system called NoSql Systems. Expect the details about NoSql Systems on my next post..</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">So i'm signing off here reminding, we are just in the beginning of this data explosion era and we are facing a lot of changes in our life style already. So it's just beginning of the game.</span>
